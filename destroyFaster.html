        Destroy Faster is a fast-paced game where players must destroy box objects by clicking on them before they disappear. 
        Players can choose from three difficulty modes - easy, normal, and hard - each with a different number of boxes to destroy 
        and a different time limit. The game is designed to be quick and addictive, with players striving to beat their high scores 
        and compete with friends.
